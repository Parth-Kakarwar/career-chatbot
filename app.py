5. Accept/Freeze seat
6. Document Verification
7. Fee Payment

Important Points:
• Fill 80-100 choices for safety
• Order by preference (best first)
• Include safe, moderate, and reach options
• Seat upgradation possible in later rounds
• Once frozen, cannot participate further

Rounds (typically 6):
• Round 1-5: Regular allocation
• Round 6: Special/final round

Documents Needed:
✓ JEE scorecard
✓ 10th & 12th marksheets
✓ Category certificate (if applicable)
✓ ID proof

Understanding College Cutoffs:

Opening Rank: Highest rank admitted (best student)
Closing Rank: Lowest rank admitted (last student)

Cutoff Trends:
• Decrease over rounds (seats fill up)
• Vary by category (OPEN, OBC, SC, ST, EWS)
• Change yearly based on difficulty

Example (IIT Bombay CSE 2024):
• Opening Rank: 1
• Closing Rank: 66
• Only top 66 ranks got admission!

Factors Affecting Cutoff:
1. Number of applicants
2. Exam difficulty
3. Available seats
4. Previous year trends
5. New college opening

Pro Tip: Use closing rank + 20% buffer for safety
If closing rank is 5000, aim for rank 4000 or better.
